## My process

### Built with

- Tailwind
- React
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

## 1. Using absolute and relative

In this project, I used absolute positioning for the navigation bar and relative positioning for the change image slider.

## 2. Conditional rendering

Using React media queries library to render the image based on the current viewport (mobile or desktop).

### Continued development

## 1. Don't focus too much on getting pixel perfect result

My solution is too focused on making it look nice on 1440 and 375 screen resolution which is the resolution used for the design file. This causes other resolutions to be ignored and messed up the view. In the future, focus on having fully responsive view for all resolutions and make it somewhat similar to the original design file in the process.
